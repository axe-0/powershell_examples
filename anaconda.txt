Anaconda setup 

        Step 1: Verify Installation
        First, make sure Anaconda or Miniconda is installed correctly. If not, reinstall it, ensuring you select the option to add Anaconda/Miniconda to your PATH during installation. If you missed this step during installation, you can manually add it to your PATH.

        Step 2: Manually Add Anaconda/Miniconda to PATH
        Windows:
        Locate the Installation Path:

        The default path is usually C:\Users\YourUsername\Anaconda3 or C:\Users\YourUsername\Miniconda3.
        Add to PATH:

        Open the Start Menu and search for "Environment Variables".
        Select "Edit the system environment variables".
        In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
        In the Environment Variables window, find the Path variable in the "User variables" section and select it, then click "Edit".
        Click "New" and add the path to the Anaconda/Miniconda installation directory (e.g., C:\Users\YourUsername\Anaconda3).
        Also, add the Scripts and Library\bin subdirectories. For example:
        makefile
        Copy code
        C:\Users\YourUsername\Anaconda3
        C:\Users\YourUsername\Anaconda3\Scripts
        C:\Users\YourUsername\Anaconda3\Library\bin
        Click OK on all dialogs to apply the changes.
        Open a New Command Prompt:

        Open a new Command Prompt to ensure the changes take effect and try running conda.
        macOS and Linux:
        Locate the Installation Path:

        The default path is usually ~/anaconda3 or ~/miniconda3.
        Add to PATH:

        Open a terminal.
        Edit your shell profile file (e.g., .bashrc, .bash_profile, .zshrc) using a text editor. For example:
        sh
        Copy code
        nano ~/.bashrc
        Add the following lines at the end of the file:
        sh
        Copy code
        export PATH="$HOME/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
        Save the file and exit the text editor.
        Apply the Changes:

        Reload the shell configuration file:
        sh
        Copy code
        source ~/.bashrc
        You can also close the terminal and open a new one to apply the changes.
        Verify conda:

        In the new terminal, type conda to verify if the command is now recognized.
        Step 3: Clone the Base Environment
        Once conda is recognized, you can proceed to clone the base environment as described earlier:

        Clone the base environment:

        sh
        Copy code
        conda create --name myenv --clone base
        Activate the new environment:

        sh
        Copy code
        conda activate myenv
        Verify the packages:

        sh
        Copy code
        conda list
        If you follow these steps and conda is still not recognized, you might need to troubleshoot further by ensuring there were no errors during the Anaconda/Miniconda installation process.
